clade_site_distance(
  df.TS.TE,
  df.occ,
  time.slice,
  dist.trait,
  nearest.taxon,
  group = NULL,
  group.focal.compare = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.TS.TE}{Data frame object containing at least four columns. Species names,
origination time, extinction time and a trait value for each species.}

\item{df.occ}{a data frame object containing the occurrence records for each species.
This must have at least a column indicating the name of species, its minimum and maximum age estimate,
and its site location ID.}

\item{time.slice}{Scalar indicating the time interval between consecutive time slices.}

\item{dist.trait}{A dist object containing the clade pairwise distance matrices.
The name of the clades in this object must be equal to the name of the
clades in df.TS.TE data frame.}

\item{nearest.taxon}{A scalar indicating the number of nearest species/genus that will be used.
1 computes mnnd metric and the option "all" computes mpd.}

\item{group}{Character indicating the name of the column that contain the groups that will be used
in comparison.}

\item{group.focal.compare}{Character vector indicating the focal (first element) and comparison (second element)
groups used in the calculation. If NULL, the default, the metrics  will be calculated
using all  clades.}

\item{type.comparison}{Character. It can be "between" to compute distances only between species/genus of two groups
or "within" to calculate distance only inside the focal group. If null the distance is computed
considering all clades together}

\item{trait}{Character indicating the name of the column containing values of the traits for each species. If NULL,
the default, the user must provide a distance matrix.}

\item{round.digits}{Scalar indicating the precision of time slices.}

\item{species}{Character indicating the name of the column of the data frame
containing the species name information.}

\item{TS}{Character indicating the name of the columns of the data frame
containing the information on origination time.}

\item{TE}{Character indicating the name of the column of the data frame
containing the information on extinction time.}

\item{Max.age}{Character indicating the name of the column containing the upper age limit for occurrence record.}

\item{Min.age}{Character indicating the name of the column containing the lower age limit for occurrence record.}

\item{site}{Character indicating the name of the column containing the information on site location.}
