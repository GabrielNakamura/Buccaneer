\title{Calculate Mean Site-Level Species Coexistence Across Time Slices}
\usage{
clade_site_coexistence(
  df.TS.TE,
  df.occ,
  time.slice,
  round.digits = 1,
  species = "species",
  TS = "TS",
  TE = "TE",
  Max.age = "Max.age",
  Min.age = "Min.age",
  site = "site",
  remove.singletons = TRUE,
  group = NULL,
  group.focal.compare = NULL,
  type.comparison = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.TS.TE}{A data frame containing species temporal data with at least
three columns: species names, origination times (TS), and extinction
times (TE). Additional columns may include group assignments.}

\item{df.occ}{A data frame containing fossil occurrence records with at least
four columns: species names, minimum age, maximum age, and site location ID.
Each row represents a single occurrence record at a specific site.}

\item{time.slice}{Numeric. The time interval (in the same units as TS and TE)
between consecutive time slices for temporal binning.}

\item{round.digits}{Integer. The number of decimal places to round time slice
values. Default is 1. This affects temporal binning precision.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} and
\code{df.occ} containing species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{TS}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
origination (first appearance) times for each species. Default is "TS".}

\item{TE}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
extinction (last appearance) times for each species. Default is "TE".}

\item{Max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Max.age".}

\item{Min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Min.age".}

\item{site}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
site location identifiers. Default is "site".}

\item{remove.singletons}{Logical. Should singleton species (species occurring
alone at a site with no co-occurring species) be excluded from mean and
variance calculations? Default is TRUE. When TRUE, singletons are treated
as NA; when FALSE, they contribute 0 to the mean.}

\item{group}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
group assignments for species (e.g., clade, family). Required if using
\code{group.focal.compare}. Default is NULL.}

\item{group.focal.compare}{Character vector of length 2. The first element
specifies the focal group and the second specifies the comparison group.
If NULL (default), coexistence is calculated across all species regardless
of group membership.}

\item{type.comparison}{Character. Specifies the type of coexistence comparison:
\itemize{
\item \code{"between"}: Count only co-occurrences between species from
the focal and comparison groups.
\item \code{"within"}: Count only co-occurrences among species within
the focal group.
\item NULL (default): Count all co-occurrences regardless of group.
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns:
\item{mean.coexistence}{Numeric. The mean number of co-occurring species in
each time slice. This represents average local coexistence
(excluding or including singletons based on \code{remove.singletons}).}
\item{var.distance}{Numeric. The variance in the number of co-occurring
species in each time slice.}
\item{time.slice}{Numeric. The time point representing each slice, typically
the upper (older) boundary of the time bin.}
}
\description{
This function computes the mean number of co-occurring species at individual
sites across different time slices. For each time slice, it determines which
species co-occur at each site based on occurrence records and temporal ranges,
then calculates the mean and variance of coexistence across all species for
time slice.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Creates time slices from maximum TS to minimum TE
\item Generates regional co-occurrence matrices using \code{aux_matrix_regional_coex()}
\item Determines which species occur at which sites in each time slice
\item Creates site-based co-occurrence matrices using \code{comp_site_cooccurr()}
\item For each species at each site, counts the number of co-occurring species
\item Calculates mean and variance of coexistence across species with
cooccurrence in sites
\item Optionally filters by group membership
}

Coexistence calculation details:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Self-coexistence}: Removed from counts (a species does not
"co-occur" with itself)
\item \strong{Singleton species}: Species with 0 co-occurring taxa
\itemize{
\item If \code{remove.singletons = TRUE}: Treated as NA (excluded from mean)
\item If \code{remove.singletons = FALSE}: Contribute 0 to the mean
}
\item \strong{Group comparisons}: When using \code{group.focal.compare},
only counts co-occurrences between/within specified groups
}

This function calculates site-level (local) coexistence patterns, which differ
from regional-scale richness. For regional richness, see \code{clade_regional_coexistence()}.
