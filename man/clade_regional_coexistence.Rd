\title{Calculate Regional Species Richness Across Time Slices}
\usage{
clade_regional_coexistence(
  df.TS.TE,
  time.slice,
  round.digits = 1,
  species = "species",
  TS = "TS",
  TE = "TE"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.TS.TE}{A data frame containing species temporal data with at least
three columns: species names, origination times (TS), and extinction
times (TE). Each row represents one species with its temporal range.}

\item{time.slice}{Numeric. The time interval (in the same units as TS and TE)
between consecutive time slices. Negative values will create backwards
intervals from maximum TS to minimum TE.}

\item{round.digits}{Integer. The number of decimal places to round time slice
values. Default is 1. This affects the precision of temporal binning.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{TS}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
origination (first appearance) times for each species. Default is "TS".}

\item{TE}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
extinction (last appearance) times for each species. Default is "TE".}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\item{coexistence}{Numeric. The number of species present (coexisting) in
each time slice at the regional scale.}
\item{time.slice}{Numeric. The time point representing each slice, typically
the upper (older) boundary of the time bin.}
}
\description{
This function computes the number of species (or lineages) present at the
regional scale for each time slice based on species temporal ranges. It
divides the temporal range into discrete intervals and counts how many species'
longevities (origination to extinction) overlap with each time slice. This
provides a time series of regional taxonomic richness through geological time.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Creates a sequence of time slices from the maximum TS to minimum TE
\item Generates regional co-occurrence matrices using \code{aux_matrix_regional_coex()}
\item For each time slice, identifies species whose temporal ranges overlap
with that interval (TS >= time slice AND TE <= time slice)
\item Counts the number of overlapping species (richness) for each time slice
}

The term "coexistence" refers to the number of species whose temporal ranges
overlap with each time slice, representing standing diversity at the regional
scale. This is equivalent to species richness through time when all species
in the region are considered.

Note: This function calculates richness at the regional (pool) scale, not
at individual sites. For site-level or assemblage-level richness, see
\code{Assemblage_regional_richness()}.
