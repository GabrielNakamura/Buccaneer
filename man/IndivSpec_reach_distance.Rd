}
\arguments{
\item{df.TS.TE}{A data frame containing species temporal data with at least
three columns: species names, origination times (TS), and extinction
times (TE). Additional columns may include group assignments.}

\item{df.occ}{data frame containing fossil occurrence records with at least
five columns: species names, minimum age, maximum age, and latitude and
longitude.
Each row represents a single occurrence record at a specific site.}

\item{time.slice}{Numeric. The time interval (in the same units as TS and TE)
between consecutive time slices for temporal binning.}

\item{dist.trait}{A distance matrix object (class \code{dist} or \code{matrix})
containing pairwise trait distances between species. Row and column names
must match species names in \code{df.TS.TE}. If NULL, distances will be
computed from the trait column using Euclidean distance.}

\item{nearest.taxon}{Numeric or character. The number of nearest neighbors to
consider when calculating mean distances. Use \code{1} for mean nearest
neighbor distance (MNND), or \code{"all"} for mean pairwise distance (MPD).}

\item{group}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
group assignments for species (e.g., clade, family). Required if using
\code{group.focal.compare}. Default is NULL.}

\item{group.focal.compare}{Character vector of length 2. The first element
specifies the focal group and the second specifies the comparison group.
If NULL (default), coexistence is calculated across all species regardless
of group membership.}

\item{type.comparison}{Character. Specifies the type of coexistence comparison:
\itemize{
\item \code{"between"}: Count only co-occurrences between species from
the focal and comparison groups.
\item \code{"within"}: Count only co-occurrences among species within
the focal group.
\item NULL (default): Count all co-occurrences regardless of group.
}}

\item{round.digits}{Integer. The number of decimal places to round time slice
values. Default is 1. This affects temporal binning precision.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} and
\code{df.occ} containing species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{TS}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
origination (first appearance) times for each species. Default is "TS".}

\item{TE}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
extinction (last appearance) times for each species. Default is "TE".}

\item{Max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Max.age".}

\item{Min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Min.age".}

\item{lat}{Numeric. The latitude coordinate of the occurrence record in
\code{df.occ}.}

\item{lon}{Numeric. The longitude coordinate of the occurrence records in
\code{df.occ}.}

\item{crs}{Numeric. The code indicating the coordinate reference system
to be used for latitude and longitude of occurrence records in \code{df.occ}}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns:
\item{mean.distance}{Numeric. The mean distance for each individual species in
each time slice for all other cooccurring species according with
reach criteria. This represents average distance of each species in the
morphospace relative to all other cooccurring species
(excluding or including singletons based on \code{remove.singletons}).}
\item{var.distance}{Numeric. The variance in the mean distance for each
individual species in each time slice.}
\item{time.slice}{Numeric. The time point representing each slice, typically
the upper (older) boundary of the time bin.}
