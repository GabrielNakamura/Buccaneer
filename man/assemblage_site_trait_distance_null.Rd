\arguments{
\item{df.TS.TE}{Data frame object containing at least four columns. Species names,
origination time, extinction time and a trait value for each species.}

\item{df.occ}{A data frame containing fossil occurrence records with at least
four columns: species names, minimum age, maximum age, and site location ID.
Each row represents a single occurrence record at a specific site.}

\item{time.slice}{Numeric. The time interval (in the same units as TS and TE)
between consecutive time slices for temporal binning.}

\item{dist_matrix_trait}{A distance matrix object (class \code{dist} or \code{matrix})
containing pairwise trait distances between species. Row and column names
must match species names in \code{df.TS.TE}. If NULL, distances will be
computed from the trait column using Euclidean distance.}

\item{round.digits}{Integer. The number of decimal places to round time slice
values. Default is 1. This affects temporal binning precision.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} and
\code{df.occ} containing species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{TS}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
origination (first appearance) times for each species. Default is "TS".}

\item{TE}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
extinction (last appearance) times for each species. Default is "TE".}

\item{Max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Max.age".}

\item{Min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Min.age".}

\item{site}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
site location identifiers. Default is "site".}

\item{nearest.taxon}{Character, indicating the mean distance to be used. If
\code{"mpd"} mean pairwise distance will be calculated, if \code{mnnd}
mean nearest neighbour distance will be computed, considering only the
distant to the closest species in the morphospace.}

\item{nperm}{A scalar, indicating the number of permutations to be used in the
null model}

\item{fixedmar}{Character, stating which row/column sums should be preserved
in the assemblage composition matrix (sites in the rows and species in the
columns). Options are "none", "rows", "columns" or "both".}

\item{mtype}{Character, indicanting the type of null model to be performed.
\code{"prab"} is the option for presence-absence (detection/non-detection)
matrix and \code{"count"} for matrix with count data.}
