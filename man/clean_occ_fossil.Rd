\usage{
clean_occ_fossil(
  df.occ.fossil,
  method.ages = c("midpoint", "upper", "lower"),
  thresh.age.range = 10,
  species = "species",
  Max.age = "Maximum_Age",
  Min.age = "Minimum_Age",
  remove.sub.species = TRUE,
  comp.TS.TE = TRUE,
  lat = NULL,
  lng = NULL,
  site = NULL,
  group = NULL,
  trait = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.occ.fossil}{A data frame containing fossil occurrence records with at
least three columns: species names, maximum (oldest) age estimates, and
minimum (youngest) age estimates. Additional columns may include spatial
coordinates, site information, group assignments, and trait values.}

\item{method.ages}{Character. The method used to estimate representative ages
from occurrence records. Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"midpoint"} (default): Calculate the midpoint between max and min ages
\item \code{"upper"}: Use the maximum (oldest) age
\item \code{"lower"}: Use the minimum (youngest) age
}
Note: Currently, the function always calculates midpoint regardless of this parameter.}

\item{thresh.age.range}{Numeric. The threshold for flagging occurrence records
with large age uncertainties (in millions of years or appropriate time units).
Records with age ranges (Max.age - Min.age) greater than or equal to this
value are flagged as \code{flag.age.range = "TRUE"}. Default is 10.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ.fossil}
containing species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{Max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ.fossil}
containing the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record.
Default is "Maximum_Age".}

\item{Min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ.fossil}
containing the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record.
Default is "Minimum_Age".}

\item{remove.sub.species}{Logical. Should subspecies-level identifications be
flagged? Default is TRUE. When TRUE, adds a \code{subspecies} column
identifying records with three or more words in the species name (e.g.,
"Genus species subspecies").}

\item{comp.TS.TE}{Logical. Should species-level temporal ranges (origination
and extinction times) be computed? Default is TRUE. When TRUE, calculates
TS (maximum of Max.age) and TE (minimum of Min.age) for each species.}

\item{lat}{Character. The name of the column containing latitude coordinates.
Default is NULL. If provided, latitude information is retained in output.}

\item{lng}{Character. The name of the column containing longitude coordinates.
Default is NULL. If provided, longitude information is retained in output.}

\item{site}{Character. The name of the column containing site location identifiers.
Default is NULL. If provided, site information is retained in output.}

\item{group}{Character. The name of the column containing group assignments
for species (e.g., clade, family). Default is NULL. If provided, group
information is retained in output.}

\item{trait}{Character. The name of the column containing trait values for
species. Default is NULL. If provided, trait information is retained in output.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing all original columns plus the following added columns:
\item{midpoint}{Numeric. The midpoint age calculated as (Max.age + Min.age) / 2.}
\item{age.range}{Numeric. The age uncertainty calculated as Max.age - Min.age.}
\item{flag.age.range}{Character. "TRUE" if age.range >= thresh.age.range,
"FALSE" otherwise. Flags occurrences with potentially problematic age uncertainties.}
\item{TS}{Numeric (optional, if comp.TS.TE = TRUE). Species origination time,
calculated as the maximum Max.age across all occurrences of that species.}
\item{TE}{Numeric (optional, if comp.TS.TE = TRUE). Species extinction time,
calculated as the minimum Min.age across all occurrences of that species.}
\item{subspecies}{Character (optional, if remove.sub.species = TRUE).
"subspecies" if the species name has three or more words, "species" otherwise.}
}
\description{
This function processes and standardizes fossil occurrence records by calculating
age estimates (midpoint, upper, or lower bounds), computing age uncertainties,
flagging records with large age ranges, optionally computing species temporal
ranges (origination and extinction times), and identifying subspecies-level
identifications. It provides a comprehensive data cleaning pipeline for
paleobiological analyses.
}
\details{
The function performs the following data cleaning and flagging steps:
\enumerate{
\item Subsets and standardizes column names
\item Converts Max.age and Min.age to numeric (removing non-numeric values)
\item Calculates midpoint ages: (Max.age + Min.age) / 2
\item Calculates age uncertainties: Max.age - Min.age
\item Flags records with age.range >= thresh.age.range
\item Optionally computes species temporal ranges (TS and TE)
\item Optionally identifies subspecies-level records
\item Removes records with NA values in TS or TE (with warning)
}

Age uncertainty considerations:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Purpose}: Large age ranges indicate temporal imprecision
\item \strong{Threshold}: User-defined via \code{thresh.age.range}
\item \strong{Action}: Records are flagged but not removed, allowing users
to decide how to handle them in downstream analyses
\item \strong{Typical thresholds}: 5-10 Ma for Cenozoic studies, 10-20 Ma
for Mesozoic studies
}

Subspecies identification:
\itemize{
\item Uses word count in species names (binomial = 2 words, trinomial >= 3 words)
\item May require manual verification as some valid species names have
multiple words (e.g., "Genus species complex")
\item Useful for standardizing taxonomic resolution in analyses
}

Missing value handling:
\itemize{
\item Non-numeric age values are converted to NA
\item Records with NA in TS or TE are removed (when comp.TS.TE = TRUE)
\item A warning is issued when NAs are found and removed
}
