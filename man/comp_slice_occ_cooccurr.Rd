\title{Calculate Species Co-occurrence Matrices Based on Time Slice Overlap}
\usage{
comp_slice_occ_cooccurr(
  spp_slice,
  df.occ,
  species = "species",
  Max.age = "Max.age",
  Min.age = "Min.age"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spp_slice}{A named list where each element contains a character vector
of species names present in a given time slice. Names of list elements
should be time slice identifiers (typically numeric values). Usually
generated by \code{calc_spp_slice()}.}

\item{df.occ}{A data frame containing fossil occurrence records with at least
four columns: species names, minimum age, maximum age, and site location ID.
Each row represents a single occurrence record at a specific site. Column
names should match the parameters below.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{Max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Max.age".}

\item{Min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Min.age".}
}
\value{
A list with length equal to the number of time slices in \code{spp_slice}.
Each element is a square matrix (species × species) where:
\itemize{
\item Row and column names are species names
\item Diagonal elements represent the number of sites where each species occurs
\item Off-diagonal elements represent the number of shared sites between
pairs of species
\item Values of 0 indicate no site overlap between species pairs
}
}
\description{
This auxiliary function computes species-by-species co-occurrence matrices for
each time slice based on shared site occupancy. Two species are considered to
co-occur if they are found at the same site during the same time slice. The
resulting matrices quantify how many sites each pair of species shares, which
can be used to calculate trait distances among co-occurring species.
