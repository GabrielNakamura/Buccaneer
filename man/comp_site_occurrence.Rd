\title{Calculate Site-Based Species Occurrence Across Time Slices}
\usage{
comp_site_occurrence(
  spp_slice,
  df.occ,
  species = "species",
  Max.age = "Max.age",
  Min.age = "Min.age",
  site = "site"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spp_slice}{A named list where each element contains a character vector
of species names present in a given time slice. Names of list elements
should be time slice identifiers (typically numeric values). Usually
generated by \code{calc_spp_slice()}.}

\item{df.occ}{A data frame containing fossil occurrence records with at least
four columns: species names, minimum age, maximum age, and site location ID.
Each row represents a single occurrence record at a specific site.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{Max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Max.age".}

\item{Min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Min.age".}

\item{site}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
site location identifiers. Default is "site".}
}
\value{
A list with length equal to the number of time slices in \code{spp_slice}.
Each element is a data frame in wide format representing a site-by-species
presence/absence matrix, with the following structure:
\itemize{
\item First column: \code{site} - Site identifiers
\item Subsequent columns: Species names as column headers, with values
of 1 (present) or 0 (absent) indicating occurrence at each site
}
}
\description{
This auxiliary function determines which species occur at which sites within
each time slice, creating presence/absence matrices for fossil assemblages.
It filters occurrence records based on temporal overlap with time slices and
generates site-by-species matrices that can be used for downstream community
ecology analyses.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps for each time slice:
\enumerate{
\item Filters \code{df.occ} to include only species present in the time slice
(based on \code{spp_slice})
\item Further filters occurrences where the age range overlaps with the time slice
(Max.age >= time slice AND Min.age <= time slice)
\item Groups occurrences by site and removes duplicate species records
\item Creates a presence/absence matrix with sites as rows and species as columns
\item Returns the matrix in wide format suitable for community ecology analyses
}

This function is typically used internally to prepare occurrence data for
calculating co-occurrence patterns, trait distances, or other community-level
metrics at the site scale.
