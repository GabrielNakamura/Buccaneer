\title{Plot Fossil Occurrence Records and Species Age Ranges}
\usage{
plot_occ_bins(
  df.occ.fossil,
  species = "accepted_name",
  max.age = "max_ma",
  min.age = "min_ma",
  occ.gradient = TRUE,
  log = TRUE,
  name.scale.occ = "viridis",
  x.axis.name = "age range",
  y.axis.name = "species.name",
  show.species.name = FALSE,
  age.scheme = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.occ.fossil}{A data frame containing fossil occurrence records with at
least three columns: species names, maximum (oldest) age estimates, and
minimum (youngest) age estimates. Each row represents a single occurrence
record with age uncertainty.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ.fossil}
containing species identifiers. Default is "accepted_name".}

\item{max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ.fossil}
containing the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record.
Default is "max_ma".}

\item{min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ.fossil}
containing the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record.
Default is "min_ma".}

\item{occ.gradient}{Logical. Should line segments be colored by the number of
occurrences for each species? If TRUE (default), species with more occurrence
records will have different colors based on the chosen color scale.}

\item{log}{Logical. Should the number of occurrences be log-transformed for
color scaling? Default is TRUE. This can help visualize species with highly
variable occurrence counts.}

\item{name.scale.occ}{Character. The name of the viridis color scale to use
for coloring by occurrence count. Options include "viridis" (default),
"magma", "plasma", "inferno", "cividis", "mako", "rocket", and "turbo".}

\item{x.axis.name}{Character. Label for the x-axis. Default is "age range".}

\item{y.axis.name}{Character. Label for the y-axis. Default is "species.name".}

\item{show.species.name}{Logical. Should species names be displayed on the
y-axis? Default is FALSE. When FALSE, y-axis labels are hidden to reduce
clutter when plotting many species.}

\item{age.scheme}{Logical. Should geological time period boundaries be overlaid
as vertical dashed lines? Default is TRUE. Currently uses North American
Land Mammal Ages (NALMAs) boundaries.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object displaying the occurrence records. Species are arranged
vertically (y-axis) sorted by their maximum age, with time (age) on the
reversed x-axis (oldest to the left, youngest to the right). Each horizontal
segment represents one occurrence record spanning its age uncertainty.
}
\description{
This function creates a visualization of fossil occurrence records showing
the temporal distribution of species across geological time. Each species is
represented by horizontal line segments spanning from maximum (oldest) to
minimum (youngest) ages for each occurrence record. The plot can optionally
color-code species by number of occurrences and overlay geological time scale
boundaries.
}
\details{
The function performs the following visualization steps:
\enumerate{
\item Orders species by their oldest occurrence (maximum age)
\item Counts the number of occurrence records per species
\item Optionally log-transforms occurrence counts for better visualization
\item Creates horizontal segments for each occurrence spanning min to max age
\item Colors segments by occurrence count using viridis color scales
\item Optionally overlays geological time boundaries
}

Visualization features:
\itemize{
\item \strong{X-axis}: Time in millions of years (Ma), reversed so older
ages appear on the left
\item \strong{Y-axis}: Species names (ordered by first appearance)
\item \strong{Color gradient}: Number of occurrences per species (with or
without log transformation)
\item \strong{Vertical lines}: Geological time period boundaries (if enabled)
}

The default geological time scheme uses North American Land Mammal Ages (NALMAs)
boundaries. To use custom time boundaries, set \code{age.scheme = FALSE} and
modify the returned ggplot object.
