\usage{
Assemblage_regional_richness(
  df.TS.TE,
  df.occ,
  time.slice,
  grid.size,
  round.digits = 1,
  species = "species",
  TS = "TS",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.TS.TE}{A data frame containing species temporal data with at least
three columns: species names, origination times (TS), and extinction
times (TE).}

\item{df.occ}{A data frame containing fossil occurrence records with at least
five columns: species names, minimum age, maximum age, latitude, and
longitude. Each row represents a single occurrence record at a specific
location.}

\item{time.slice}{Numeric. The time interval (in the same units as TS and TE)
between consecutive time slices for temporal binning.}

\item{grid.size}{Numeric. The size of grid cells in degrees for spatial binning.
For example, \code{grid.size = 5} creates 5° × 5° grid cells.}

\item{round.digits}{Integer. The number of decimal places to round time slice
values. Default is 1. This affects temporal binning precision.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} and
\code{df.occ} containing species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{TS}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
origination (start) times for each species. Default is "TS".}

\item{TE}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
extinction (end) times for each species. Default is "TE".}

\item{Max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Max.age".}

\item{Min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Min.age".}

\item{lat}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
latitude coordinates for occurrence records. Default is "lat".}

\item{lon}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
longitude coordinates for occurrence records. Default is "lng".}

\item{crs}{Numeric or character. The coordinate reference system (CRS) code
for spatial data. Default is 4326 (WGS84 geographic coordinates).}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\item{grid_mean_age}{An sf object with grid cell geometries and temporal
summaries. Contains columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{grid_id}: Unique identifier for each grid cell
\item \code{mean.age.grid}: Mean age of all occurrences in the grid cell
\item \code{var.age.grid}: Variance of ages in the grid cell
\item \code{geometry}: Spatial geometry of the grid cell
}}
\item{time_series_rich}{A data frame with richness metric for each grid
cell and time slice. Contains columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{grid_id}: Grid cell identifier
\item \code{mean.age.grid}: Mean age of occurrences in the grid cell
\item \code{var.age.grid}: Variance of ages in the grid cell
\item \code{time.slice}: Time slice identifier
\item \code{rich.by.grid}: Species richness in the grid cell during the time slice
\item \code{mean.rich.by.grid.slice}: Mean richness across all grid cells in the time slice
\item \code{geometry}: Spatial geometry of the grid cell
}}
}
\description{
This function computes species richness for fossil assemblages across spatial
grid cells and temporal bins. It divides geographic space into a regular grid
and temporal ranges into discrete time slices, then calculates the number of
species present in each grid cell during each time slice based on occurrence
records and species longevities.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Creates a spatial grid covering the extent of occurrence records
\item Assigns each occurrence to a grid cell based on coordinates
\item Calculates temporal statistics (mean and variance of ages) for each grid cell
\item Divides the temporal range into discrete time slices
\item For each time slice, identifies species present based on longevities
\item Counts species richness in each grid cell for each time slice
\item Computes mean richness across grid cells within each time slice
}

Missing or invalid coordinates (NA values) are automatically removed before
spatial analysis. Grid cells without occurrences in a time slice will not
appear in the results for that time slice.
