}
\arguments{
\item{df.occ.fossil}{A data frame containing fossil occurrence records with
columns for species names, age estimates (maximum and minimum ages, or
midpoint), and optionally spatial coordinates, site information, group
assignments, and trait values.}

\item{interval}{Numeric vector. A sequence of time bin boundaries in descending
order (from oldest to youngest). For example, \code{c(100, 90, 80, 70)}
creates three time bins: 100-90, 90-80, and 80-70. Must have at least
two elements.}

\item{age.occ}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ.fossil}
containing the age estimate used for binning occurrences. Typically
"midpoint" for the midpoint between maximum and minimum ages. Default is "midpoint".}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ.fossil}
containing species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{Max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ.fossil}
containing the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record.
Default is "Maximum_Age".}

\item{Min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ.fossil}
containing the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record.
Default is "Minimum_Age".}

\item{TS}{Character. The name of the column containing origination (first
appearance) times. Default is NULL. This parameter is retained for future
functionality but not currently used in calculations.}

\item{TE}{Character. The name of the column containing extinction (last
appearance) times. Default is NULL. This parameter is retained for future
functionality but not currently used in calculations.}

\item{lat}{Character. The name of the column containing latitude coordinates.
Default is NULL. If provided, latitude information is retained in output.}

\item{lng}{Character. The name of the column containing longitude coordinates.
Default is NULL. If provided, longitude information is retained in output.}

\item{site}{Character. The name of the column containing site location identifiers.
Default is NULL. If provided, site information is retained in output.}

\item{group}{Character. The name of the column containing group assignments
for species (e.g., clade, family). Default is NULL. If provided, group
information is retained in output.}

\item{trait}{Character. The name of the column containing trait values for
species. Default is NULL. If provided, trait information is retained in output.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently not used but reserved for future extensions).}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames:
\item{df_summary_occurrences}{A data frame with all occurrence records
augmented with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{time.interval}: Character. The time bin identifier (e.g., "100-90")
\item \code{n.records.bin}: Integer. The total number of occurrence
records in that time interval
}
This data frame has one row per occurrence record.}
\item{df_summary_richness}{A data frame with unique species per time interval
augmented with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{time.interval}: Character. The time bin identifier
\item \code{n.species.bin}: Integer. The number of unique species
(taxonomic richness) in that time interval
}
This data frame has one row per unique species per time interval.}
}
\description{
This function calculates summary statistics for fossil occurrence records
grouped into discrete time intervals (bins). For each time interval, it
computes the number of occurrence records and the number of unique species
(taxonomic richness). The function bins occurrences based on their age
estimates and provides both record-level and species-level summaries.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Validates that input is a data frame
\item Extracts specified columns from the occurrence data
\item For each time interval (consecutive pairs in \code{interval}):
\itemize{
\item Filters occurrences where \code{age.occ} falls within the interval
\item Assigns a time interval label (e.g., "100-90")
}
\item Calculates summary statistics:
\itemize{
\item \strong{n.records.bin}: Total number of occurrences per interval
\item \strong{n.species.bin}: Number of unique species per interval
}
}

Binning logic:
\itemize{
\item An occurrence is assigned to an interval if: \code{interval[i] >= age.occ >= interval[i+1]}
\item Intervals are labeled using the format "upper-lower" (e.g., "100-90")
\item Occurrences falling outside all intervals are excluded
}

The two output data frames serve different purposes:
\itemize{
\item \strong{df_summary_occurrences}: Retains all individual occurrence
records for detailed analyses (e.g., spatial patterns, within-interval variation)
\item \strong{df_summary_richness}: Provides species-level summaries for
diversity analyses (e.g., richness through time, turnover rates)
}
