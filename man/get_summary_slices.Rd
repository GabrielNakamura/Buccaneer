\usage{
get_summary_slices(
  df.TS.TE,
  timeframe,
  method.ages = c("midpoint", "upper", "lower"),
  thresh.age.range = 10,
  species = "species",
  Max.age = "Maximum_Age",
  Min.age = "Minimum_Age",

  TE = NULL,
  lat = NULL,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.TS.TE}{A data frame containing fossil occurrence records with at least
three columns: species names, maximum (oldest) age estimates, and minimum
(youngest) age estimates. Additional columns may include spatial coordinates,
site information, group assignments, and trait values.}

\item{timeframe}{Numeric. The time interval (in millions of years or appropriate
time units) between consecutive time slices. Negative values will create
backwards intervals from the oldest to youngest occurrences.}

\item{method.ages}{Character. The method used to estimate species ages from
occurrence records. Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"midpoint"} (default): Use the midpoint between max and min ages
\item \code{"upper"}: Use the maximum (oldest) age
\item \code{"lower"}: Use the minimum (youngest) age
}}

\item{thresh.age.range}{Numeric. The threshold for flagging occurrence records
with large age uncertainties. Records with age ranges (Max.age - Min.age)
greater than or equal to this value are flagged. Default is 10.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{Max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Maximum_Age".}

\item{Min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.TS.TE} containing
the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Minimum_Age".}

\item{TS}{Character. The name of the column containing origination (first
appearance) times. Default is NULL. If NULL, TS is calculated as the
maximum midpoint age for each species.}

\item{TE}{Character. The name of the column containing extinction (last
appearance) times. Default is NULL. If NULL, TE is calculated as the
minimum midpoint age for each species.}

\item{lat}{Character. The name of the column containing latitude coordinates.
Default is NULL. If provided, latitude information is retained in output.}

\item{lng}{Character. The name of the column containing longitude coordinates.
Default is NULL. If provided, longitude information is retained in output.}

\item{site}{Character. The name of the column containing site location identifiers.
Default is NULL. If provided, site information is retained in output.}

\item{group}{Character. The name of the column containing group assignments
for species (e.g., clade, family). Default is NULL. If provided, group
information is retained in output.}

\item{trait}{Character. The name of the column containing trait values for
species. Default is NULL. If provided, trait information is retained in output.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently not used but reserved for future extensions).}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\item{df_sub_bin}{A named list of data frames, one for each time slice.
Each data frame contains all occurrence records present in that slice,
with added columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{midpoint}: Numeric. The midpoint age of each occurrence
\item \code{age.range}: Numeric. The age uncertainty (Max.age - Min.age)
\item \code{flag.age.range}: Character. "TRUE" if age.range >= thresh.age.range,
"FALSE" otherwise
\item \code{TS}: Numeric. Species origination time (maximum midpoint)
\item \code{TE}: Numeric. Species extinction time (minimum midpoint)
\item \code{count_records}: Integer. Number of occurrence records for
each species in that time slice
}
List names follow the format "slice_X" where X is the time slice value.}
\item{coex_matrix}{A named list of binary co-occurrence matrices, one for
each time slice. Each matrix:
\itemize{
\item Has dimensions: n × n, where n = total number of unique species
in the dataset
\item Contains 1 if a species is present in the time slice, 0 if absent
\item Has row and column names as species identifiers
}
List names follow the format "slice_X".}
}
\description{
This function processes fossil occurrence data to generate summaries across
discrete time slices. It calculates species temporal ranges (origination and
extinction times) from occurrence records, identifies which species are present
in each time slice, counts occurrence records per species, and creates
species-by-species co-occurrence matrices. The function also flags occurrences
with large age uncertainties based on a user-defined threshold.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Validates input data structure (must be a data frame)
\item Calculates midpoint ages for each occurrence: (Max.age + Min.age) / 2
\item Calculates age uncertainties: Max.age - Min.age
\item Flags occurrences with age uncertainties >= thresh.age.range
\item Computes species temporal ranges (TS and TE) from occurrence midpoints
\item Creates time slices from oldest to youngest occurrence
\item For each time slice, identifies species present (TS >= slice AND TE <= slice)
\item Counts occurrence records per species per time slice
\item Generates binary co-occurrence matrices for each time slice
}

Age uncertainty handling:
\itemize{
\item \strong{flag.age.range}: Identifies potentially problematic occurrences
with large temporal uncertainties
\item \strong{Threshold}: Adjustable via \code{thresh.age.range} parameter
\item \strong{Use case}: Helps assess data quality and decide whether to
filter or weight occurrences differently
}

Missing value handling:
\itemize{
\item NA values in TS or TE columns trigger a warning and are removed
\item Non-numeric TS or TE values trigger an error
}

This function is useful for preparing fossil occurrence data for downstream
analyses such as diversity dynamics, trait evolution, or biogeographic patterns
through time.
