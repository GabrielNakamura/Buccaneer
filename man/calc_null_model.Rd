\title{Calculate Null Model for Trait Distances with Fixed Site Richness}
\usage{
calc_null_model(
  list_occurrence,
  dist_matrix_trait,
  nearest.taxon,
  nperm = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_occurrence}{A list where each element represents a time slice and
contains a data frame of species occurrences across sites or assemblages.
Each data frame should have sites as rows and species as columns (plus
one column for site identifiers). Presence is indicated by 1, absence by 0.}

\item{dist_matrix_trait}{A distance matrix (class \code{matrix} or \code{dist})
containing pairwise trait distances between species. Row and column names
must match species names in \code{list_occurrence}.}

\item{nearest.taxon}{Numeric or character. The number of nearest neighbors to
consider when calculating mean distances. Use a numeric value (e.g., \code{1})
for mean nearest neighbor distance (MNND), or \code{"all"} for mean pairwise
distance (MPD).}

\item{nperm}{Integer. The number of permutations to generate for the null model.
Default is 1000. Higher values provide more robust null distributions but
increase computation time.}
}
\value{
A matrix with \code{nperm} rows and columns equal to the length of
\code{list_occurrence}. Each row represents one permutation, and each column
represents one time slice. Cell values contain mean trait distances calculated
from the randomized occurrence data.
}
\description{
This function generates null distributions of trait distances by randomly
permuting species occurrences across sites while maintaining the observed
number of species per site (fixed row sums) and total occurrences per species
(fixed column sums). It computes mean trait distances for each permutation
to create null expectations for comparing against observed patterns.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps for each time slice:
\enumerate{
\item Generates \code{nperm} random permutations of the occurrence matrix
using \code{vegan::permatfull()} with fixed row and column margins
\item For each permutation, creates a species co-occurrence matrix
\item Filters the trait distance matrix to include only co-occurring species
\item Calculates mean distances based on \code{nearest.taxon}:
\itemize{
\item If numeric: computes mean of the \code{nearest.taxon} nearest neighbors
\item If "all": computes mean pairwise distance (MPD) among all co-occurring species
}
}

The null model maintains:
\itemize{
\item Species richness at each site (row sums)
\item Total number of occurrences for each species (column sums)
\item Presence/absence structure (binary data)
}

This approach tests whether observed trait distances deviate from expectations
under random community assembly constrained by species prevalence and site richness.
