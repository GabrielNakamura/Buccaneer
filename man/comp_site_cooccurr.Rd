\title{Calculate Species Co-occurrence Matrices Based on Site Overlap Across Time Slices}
\usage{
comp_site_cooccurr(
  spp_slice,
  df.occ,
  species = "species",
  Max.age = "Max.age",
  Min.age = "Min.age",
  site = "site"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spp_slice}{A named list where each element contains a character vector
of species names present in a given time slice. Names of list elements
should be time slice identifiers (typically numeric values). Usually
generated by \code{calc_spp_slice()}.}

\item{df.occ}{A data frame containing fossil occurrence records with at least
four columns: species names, minimum age, maximum age, and site location ID.
Each row represents a single occurrence record at a specific site. Column
names should match the parameters below.}

\item{species}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
species identifiers. Default is "species".}

\item{Max.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the maximum (oldest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Max.age".}

\item{Min.age}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
the minimum (youngest) age estimate for each occurrence record. Default is "Min.age".}

\item{site}{Character. The name of the column in \code{df.occ} containing
site location identifiers. Default is "site".}
}
\value{
A list with length equal to the number of time slices in \code{spp_slice}.
Each element is a square matrix (species × species) where:
\itemize{
\item Row and column names are species names
\item Diagonal elements represent the number of sites where each species occurs
\item Off-diagonal elements represent the number of shared sites between
pairs of species
\item Values of 0 indicate no site overlap between species pairs
}
}
\description{
This auxiliary function computes species-by-species co-occurrence matrices for
each time slice based on shared site occupancy. Two species are considered to
co-occur if they are found at the same site during the same time slice. The
resulting matrices quantify how many sites each pair of species shares, which
can be used to calculate trait distances among co-occurring species.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps for each time slice:
\enumerate{
\item Filters \code{df.occ} to include only species present in the time slice
\item Further filters occurrences where the age range overlaps with the time slice
(Max.age >= time slice AND Min.age <= time slice)
\item Removes duplicate species records within sites
\item Creates a site-by-species presence/absence matrix
\item Computes the cross-product (t(matrix) \\%*\\% matrix) to generate a
species-by-species co-occurrence matrix
}

The resulting co-occurrence matrix quantifies spatial overlap:
\itemize{
\item Diagonal values = total number of sites occupied by each species
\item Off-diagonal values = number of sites shared by species pairs
\item This differs from simple presence/absence (0/1) co-occurrence
}

This function is typically used internally by \code{IndivSpec_site_distance()}
and related functions to determine which species co-occur at sites before
calculating trait-based community metrics.
