            Understanding biodiversity patterns and the processes that generate them are key goals in macroevolution. Diversity-dependent models of diversification have been used to indirectly infer the relevance of interspecific competition on diversification dynamics. Here, we develop a new approach that more explicitly incorporates spatial and ecomorphological overlap among species to test how interspecific competition may affect diversification dynamics. We build different metrics that capture temporal and spatial coexistence, and ecological overlap to test the hypothesis that an increase in the intensity of competition would result in a decrease in speciation and an increase in extinction rate. We test our predictions using the fossil record of North American canids, a group that has been well characterized both ecologically and from a paleontological point of view. We find that interspecific competition only resulted in the suppression of speciation rate at the time the clade was expanding in diversity. We find no association with extinction dynamics, nor an association between changes in diversification dynamics and changes in temperature. We discuss how evaluating the role of interspecific competition using different metrics that better capture the intensity of competition might be a way forward to investigate the role of biotic interactions at deep time..},

                  Despite the advancement of phylogenetic methods to estimate speciation and extinction rates, their power can be limited under variable rates, in particular for clades with high extinction rates and small number of extant species. Fossil data can provide a powerful alternative source of information to investigate diversification processes.
                
                
                  Here, we present PyRate, a computer program to estimate speciation and extinction rates and their temporal dynamics from fossil occurrence data. The rates are inferred in a Bayesian framework and are comparable to those estimated from phylogenetic trees.
                
                
                  We describe how PyRate can be used to explore different models of diversification. In addition to the diversification rates, it provides estimates of the parameters of the preservation process (fossilization and sampling) and the times of speciation and extinction of each species in the data set. Moreover, we develop a new birth–death model to correlate the variation of speciation/extinction rates with changes of a continuous trait.
                
                
                  
                    Finally, we demonstrate the use of Bayes factors for model selection and show how the posterior estimates of a PyRate analysis can be used to generate calibration densities for Bayesian molecular clock analysis. PyRate is an open‐source command‐line Python program available at
