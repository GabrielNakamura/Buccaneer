# Context

Buccaneer is an R package for estimating competition and coexistence
metrics through deep time using fossil data. It lets you explore how
competition changes across different biological levels (clades, species,
and assemblages) and spatial scales (local and regional).

To get started, you only need a few core inputs: species longevities,
fossil occurrence records with spatial information, and species traits.
Buccaneer’s main functions then generate flexible, customizable time
series of competition and co-occurrence metrics that can be tailored to
a wide range of evolutionary and paleoecological questions.
